# Forge - Node Project 3 Machine Learning
#### Applying Node data visualization and machine learning lessons 

### Project Goals:
##### (1) Do basic EDA
##### (2) Preprocess the data
##### (3) Create a ML model
##### (4) Evaluate the model performance

### Project Focus:
#### Utilizing data from Kaggle and the Global Terrorism Database, I have collected, analyzed, and visualized terrorism data patterns and used machine learning (Tree based model) to determine if terrorist suicide is predictable.Â¶
